# CS3800 Project (Fall 2019)

The aim of this project is to create a simulation of one of the scheduling method whichs Linux employs: Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). The simulation is visualized using a modified version of a project by David Galles (https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/).

The app uses pure javascript, html, and css - so all that is needed is a web browser. After cloning the repo, open up `CFS.html` in a web browser to begin. You will be presented with an input field allowing you to customize the processes to simulate.

Here is what the app looks like in action:
